        <h1>Personal Stories</h1>
        <p>I am great with numbers, but when it comes to managing my personal life... well, let’s just say I’m still figuring it out. I can handle complex financial statements without breaking a sweat, but trying to balance a social life? That’s a whole other spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>Last year, I found myself studying for an auditing exam while going through a little personal turbulence (let’s just say I wasn’t exactly “emotionally available” at the time). I spent hours trying to understand auditor responsibilities for reportable irregularities while also wondering why someone I cared about just vanished from my life just like that (and he still viewed my status updates). Despite the tears, the distractions, and the emotional rollercoaster, I ended up with a 76% distinction. So yeah, when life throws curveballs, I may cry a little—but I still get the job done.</p>
        <p>This year, the challenges did not stop there. Between struggling with school funding, accommodation drama, and textbooks that cost as much as a small car, I was really starting to question my career path. But then, just when I was about to throw in the towel by July, a miracle happened: a bursary appeared. Six months of stress, late-night breakdowns, and wondering if my future was a financial risk all led to that moment. And even though I only "missed the mark" on two out of five modules (let’s say I didn’t quite “pass with flying colours” in those), I learned way more from that experience than I could ever have from just acing everything. Sometimes, it’s the messy moments that teach you the most.</p>
        <p>While my personal life may still need some spreadsheet-like organising, when it comes to work, I’m all about results. I know how to navigate through chaos and pressure, and if I can survive emotional curveballs and financial stress while still delivering, then I am pretty confident I can handle any challenge that comes my way at work.</p>
        </p>Please do me a tiny favour, and return to home to see other tabs. I am innovative but I am not a software engineer, haha. Designing my own website as an accountant means some functions do not work as well as they should.... for now (hehehe) </p>
